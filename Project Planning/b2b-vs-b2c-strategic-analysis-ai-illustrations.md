## Part 2: Author Pain Points - Cost of Illustrations

- Professional illustrator prices for self-publishers fall between $9,000-$20,000 range depending on level of detail, amount of characters, number of pages

## Part 3: Current Author Sentiment Toward AI Illustrations

### The Debate is Real, But Pragmatism is Winning

**Ethical Concerns (Minority Position):**
- Science Fiction Writer's Association (SFWA) has instructed staff and volunteers to avoid seeking out and intentionally using generative AI/ML tools for any internal or publicly published material
- Training data concerns: AI models trained on copyrighted works without permission
- Artist displacement fears

**Pragmatic Acceptance (Majority Position):**
- Not everyone has $500-$2,000 to spend on custom-designed book cover. Suggesting "real" authors will always find way to pay for art ignores financial realities many writers face, especially those from marginalized communities or with limited income
- Self-publishing is supposed to be democratizing force. AI is just another tool in that toolbox - one that can help talented writers with no design skills share their stories with world
- AI is proving itself valuable component in professional designer's toolkit when used strategically, ethically, and skillfully

**Market Reality:**
- Works that use generative AI in their creative process or that include AI-generated material are eligible for copyright, as they still retain centrality of human creativity
- Most self-published authors surveyed stated they don't use AI to help write their books but use it to help develop marketing materials to promote their works

**Key Insight**: Authors are **pragmatic business people**. They'll use AI if it helps them publish professionally at affordable prices.
